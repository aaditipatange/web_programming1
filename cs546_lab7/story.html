            <h1>The story goes like this...</h1>
        <p>A little girl who started her life in a place where she was nurtured and cared for by <br>
            her parents to the point that she loved her comfort more than anything, <br>
            my Dad has always been a supporting anchor no matter what I chose for myself,<br>
            He has given me immense love and support to make me the confident girl I am today, <br>
            my drive for a career in the technology sector has been there since the start, <br>
            not very unusual for the daughter <br>
            of a businessman and a homemaker to be a tech enthusiast. <br>
            Although my parents don't belong to the same field as me but their support has made me more <br>
            driven to achieve my goals and follow my dream for masters in the United States,<br>
            a hub and centre for technology. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            A masters degree in the USA has been a dream for many, <br>
            unfortunately not many can achieve it due to many reasons.<br> 
            Coming to the US has in itself been a dream come true, <br>
            coming to a new city had its own excitement. <br>
            For a girl who never travelled abroad and then coming to a city so<br>
            close to the New York City, the world's capital, <br>
            has had a different energy around me. <br>
            I wished only for the best university for my masters,<br>
            and getting an admit from the esteemed Stevens Institute of Technology got me a lot closer to my dream. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Well this is my story as of yet but a lot more to unveil in my<br>
            journey over the next many years to come. <br>
            I am going to be only optimistic about what life has to present be it something as <br>
            frivolous as getting my nails done or something major like landing <br>
            my dream job and getting my dream job, because negativity<br>
            makes life's experiences very cumbersome. <br>
